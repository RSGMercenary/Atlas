# Atlas
C# Entity Component System (ECS) Framework

Atlas is an Entity Component System (ECS) framework in C# that allows you to develop games easier. Entities are created and arranged in a hierarchy/scenegraph and can be given Components that alter their behavior. Families of Entities can be designed based on Component combinations (Transform and Render) and updated through specific Systems (Render System).
