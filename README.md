Atlas is a hierarchy-based Entity Component System (ECS) framework in C# that allows you to develop games easier. Entities are created and arranged in a hierarchy/scenegraph and can be given Components that alter their behavior. Families of Entities can be designed based on Component combinations (i.e. Transform and Render) and updated through specific Systems (i.e. Render System).
